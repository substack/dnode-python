Intended to implement the DNode protocol for python. Still a work in progress, and may not get very far (I suck @ programming and didn't write the original dnode). Will probably also be frustrating to use due to crippled python lambdas/anon. functions.

See the [node.js dnode project](http://github.com/substack/dnode) for more info.
